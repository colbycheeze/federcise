  - Categories / Tags to find solutions to fit your needs
  - See other's solutions if no "right" answer
      Thumbs up or thumbs down other's to say they completed or not
  - Time limits?
  - Promote doing weekly challenge
  - Submit your own challenges

## App Design
  - User can login with Github
